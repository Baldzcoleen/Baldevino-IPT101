Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm Amabelle Coleen D. Baldevino, a 2nd-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student, and this website was created both as a school requirement and a platform to showcase my skills in front-end web development and UI/UX design. I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of libraries like Boxicons, Font Awesome, and Typed.js to enhance interactivity and visual appeal. The site includes sections about me, my skills, selected projects, and contact details. It's fully responsive and designed with a clean, modern aesthetic that reflects my personality and growth as a developer. This project is more than just an assignmentâ€”it's a step toward building my professional presence in the tech industry. Hosted on GitHub Pages, this portfolio represents my passion for creativity, coding, and continuous learning.
